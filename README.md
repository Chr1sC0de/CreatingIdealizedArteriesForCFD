# Generating Idealized Arteries with SolidWorks, PointWise and Python for CFD in OpenFOAM

The current repository contains examples and tools necessary for creating a pipeline
for semi-automatically generating idealised arteries for CFD studies
and Deep Learning Training using [SolidWorks](https://www.solidworks.com/),
[PointWise](https://www.pointwise.com/) and python.
